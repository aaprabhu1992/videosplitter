# videosplitter
This repository was developed to split a video conferencing video recorded in the Gallery View and split it into individual videos. 
Problem Statement: Due to COVID all performances have moved to a virtual setting, if you were to record a dance or the singing of a choir, often there can be lag or syncronizing issues in the videos. This library was developed to make sure we can split the single video into multiple videos and then combine the videos in post processing and synronize everyonw.
